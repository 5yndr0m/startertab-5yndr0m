## Desires

  - [] Need to sort out the dates/times
- A running todo list that I can interact with? (google keep api is only for enterprise :( )
- How many buses are late for that day or something?
- Running/swimming/steps stats for that day
- Heart rate
- Live location?
- Quick links (lane availability?)
- Background is animated (boids?)
- Quote of the day or a photo that changes each day?
- facebook messengers?
- have my website control something? my spotify? any home automation/??
