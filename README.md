# StartPage

I've wanted a custom 'New Tab' page for quite some time now, so I figured I'd build one over the Christmas period. It uses about 5 APIs to pull down info on things that I regularly search for every day. I would love to integrate this with an Apple Watch to give my live heart rate and more metrics, but it seems that that's limited by the Apple API at the moment.
       
## Tech

Writeen in NextJS with CharkaUI.

## Potential Tiles

- [X] UV index for the day (current, peak for the day, use NIWA)
  - [X] Need to sort out the dates/times
- Quick links 
  - [X] swimming lane availability
- [X] draw a little bonsai tree
- [X] Running/swimming/steps stats for that day
- [X] Weather? (maybe make the light/dark button also show weather)
- [] have my website control something? my spotify? any home automation/??
- A running todo list that I can interact with? (google keep api is only for enterprise :( )
- How many buses are late for that day or something?
- Heart rate
- Live location?
- Background is animated (boids?)
- Quote of the day or a photo that changes each day?
- facebook messengers?
- have some art pulled from an API?
- Gotta be mobile friendly
