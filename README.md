# StartPage

I wanted a startpage - here goes

## Desires

- [X] UV index for the day (current, peak for the day, use NIWA)
  - [] Need to sort out the dates/times
- Quick links 
  - [X] swimming lane availability
- [X] draw a little bonsai tree
- [X] Running/swimming/steps stats for that day
- A running todo list that I can interact with? (google keep api is only for enterprise :( )
- How many buses are late for that day or something?
- Heart rate
- Live location?
- Weather? (maybe make the light/dark button also show weather)
- Background is animated (boids?)
- Quote of the day or a photo that changes each day?
- facebook messengers?
- have my website control something? my spotify? any home automation/??
- have some art pulled from an API?
- Gotta be mobile friendly
