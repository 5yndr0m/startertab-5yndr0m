          First off, there&apos;s an added import/export button to make it
          easier for you to manage your data. With this new feature, you can
          quickly transfer your settings and preferences from one device to
          another.

        <Text mt="2">
          There was some feedback about tile modification buttons being a bit
          annoying, so now they only display when you&apos;re in edit mode. This
          means you can focus on enjoying your content without getting
          distracted by buttons in the bottom of the tiles.
        </Text>
        <Text mt="2">
          You can now set optional titles for your RSS and Favorites Tiles. This
          gives you more control over how your tiles are displayed and
          organized, making it easier to find the content you love.
        </Text>
        <Text mt="2">
          Lastly, you can now choose your preferred sorting value on Reddit,
          including &quot;hot,&quot; &quot;top,&quot; &quot;best,&quot; or
          &quot;new&quot;. This makes it easier to find the most popular or
          newest posts on your favorite subreddits.

          I don&apos;t believe there were any bug fixes this update, is that
          possible?! Murphy&apos;s law, there&apos;s probably going about 15 now
          that I said that.
