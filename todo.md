# To Do

## Short Term

- [] use some sort of db library to interact with the local storage?

- [] Come up with more large tile designs
  - [] Javascript console (to try little code snippets)
    - - [] use eval() -> capture the output into state and display it
  - [] One stock with a graph over time - large
  - [] Need another small tile idea
    - [] Quote tile where you just enter some text
  - [] Another search tile idea?
- [] Have some way to show a favorite link with an icon?
- [] Should you use react-query to query NextJs?

- [] press "/" to instantly start searching? 

- [] Set up all default tiles to be the most liked (weather on the big one)

## Maybes

- [] Move over state management to Recoil
- [] Turn off my data and make sure that the errors are consistent
- [] Pass in all settings as primitives into the Tiles, bring the pulling down of settings into TileContainer or Tile
- [] Randomise Skeleton widths for the text feed?
- [] Sort out a skeleton / empty graph for the UV Graph
- [] Why does the large stock tile take so long to load?
- [] Any use of colors needs to be put into variables
- [] The spotify refetching of access tokens if they're stale is ugly and needs to be simplified
- [] Reddit / Hacker News Tile
  - [] Allow you to choose how many reddit posts to pull down (or infinite scrolling)
- [] The search bar could be a cute little moonscape where the day progresses (think snoopy moonphase watch)?? Maybe just a line that progresses across the screen for how many horus there are in a day
- [] notches for hours in the day with a ball above it for each hour passed, hover over to get the time
- [] Add a chime when the timer is done
- [] Add in the ability to drag the tiles around
- [] Field to change color of all text & background colors
- [] instead of editing things like the subreddit direct on the tile, it *could* open up the settings sidebar to the option to edit highlighted
- [] Have the spotify tile change background depending on album? (Probably would need to be a setting in the sidebar, could change the background of all tiles??)
- [] fix the loading flicker for the theme (background should be done SS), is this still a problem?
- [] Have a transparent bubble around the mouse that you can use as a flashlight to see the startpage behind the blurred filter when previewing??

## Long Term Maybes

- Tab's along the bottom for each theme (like an info theme, art theme etc) 
- Have a US stock one and an art tab / theme (maybe a bookmark manager tab)
- Have a premium version of the app - where you can add more tiles and move them around. You can get better feeds and iFrame's etc
- When you edit the positioning of the tiles, have a “wiggle state”. Similar to moving around apps on a mobile phone. 

## Potential Tiles

- Quick links to your favorite websites
- Heart rate (pulled from a smart watch through a phone)
- Live location (same as above)
- Background is animated (boids?)
- Quote of the day
- Emails
- Large stock tile with a graph for performance
- Add in a focus panel that blacks out for 120 seconds (somehow have a reference in there to a study before you click 'go'), it should be a circular progress thing
- Countdown to some day
- RSS feed
